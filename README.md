I used Microsoft Support and Xpert to learn how to loop through worksheets and copy from one worksheet to another in my VBA code.  I used stack overflow to learn how to return a number as a percent, which is in line 37, 97 and 99 of my VBA code.  I used stack overflow to learn how to find the last row when that is variable in my VBA code. I worked with Nic Mallett to help him with making sure cells are filled with titles on all worksheets.
